## Introduction

This data was found at https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/ and scrapped using Selenium in Python.

```{r, echo = FALSE }
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
library(DT)
library(ggrepel)
```



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
franch_stats = read.csv("franchise_stats.csv")
datatable(franch_stats)
```
Above we a table I have constructed showing the link to each team's Basketball Reference page as well as their wins, losses and championships (conveniently named Rings).


```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(franch_stats, aes(x = Losses, y = Wins, label = Teams)) + geom_point(color = "red",size =3) + geom_label_repel(aes(label = ifelse(Rings > 4, as.character(Teams),"")))
```
